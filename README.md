# ECE128_Lab1
The module design and testbench for Lab 1
designing and implementing three multiplexers:
1)8:1 mux with one-bit input and output, by using structural modeling in Verilog.
2)4:1 mux with two bits input and output, by using structural modeling in Verilog. 
3)4:1 mux with two bits input and output, by using behavioral modeling in Verilog.
